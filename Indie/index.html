<h1>The Trees and the Forest of New Towers</h1>

<p>
Michael Green has seen the future of the building industry, and that future is wood. Lots
of wood. The Vancouver-based architect is among the most ardent proponents of what is
known as mass timber, prefabricated structural wood components that can be used to
construct buildings — even large-scale buildings — faster, with less waste and eventually
with less money.

Most crucially, Mr. Green and others say, building with mass timber can ameliorate
climate change because it produces less in greenhouse gas emissions than construction
with concrete and steel. And wood has the benefit of storing the carbon dioxide trees
absorb during their growth, keeping it out of the atmosphere indefinitely.
“Roughly 11 percent of the global carbon footprint is related to what buildings are made out of,” said Mr. Green, whose mass-timber projects include the T3 office building in
Minneapolis (the name stands for timber, technology and transportation) and a pair of
buildings for Oregon State University’s College of Forestry, including a research and
development facility for the school’s TallWood Design Institute.

Over the next 40 years, he added, it is estimated that nearly 2.5 trillion square feet of new
construction will be needed to support growth in the world’s increasingly dense urban
areas, according to the 2017 Global Status Report issued by the United Nations
Environment Program. “If we continue to build the way we are,” Mr. Green said, “we are
absolutely not going to meet any kind of climate objective, and we’re going to change our
children’s future forever in a pretty bad way.”

While cutting down trees to make buildings may not sound environmentally sensitive,
mass timber supporters argue that wood could be harvested from sustainably managed
forests.

Increasing numbers of architects, developers, governments, educational institutions and
corporations are embracing wood. In Biel, Switzerland, Swatch Group just completed
three buildings said to be among the largest timber construction projects in the world.
Designed by Shigeru Ban, an architect admired for his innovative use of wood, the
complex includes a serpentine company headquarters wrapped in a spectacular latticed
timber facade.

Notably, big players in the tech world are adopting wood. Microsoft is using mass timber
throughout its new Silicon Valley campus, while Sidewalk Labs, Google’s sister
company, has plans for a new waterfront district in Toronto consisting of wood buildings,
some as tall as 30 stories.

“We’re past the tipping point in the acceptance of wood,” said Thomas Robinson, founder
of the Portland, Ore., firm Lever Architecture, which recently completed the Nature
Conservancy’s local offices and community center using Forest Stewardship Councilcertified
wood and is working on an expanded mass-timber headquarters for Adidas.
“The people who are the innovators, looking for the next thing, a richer experience for
their employees or how they live, they’re turning to mass timber.”
The benefits are aesthetic and environmentally responsible, he added. “People just
connect to wood in a way that is visceral.”
