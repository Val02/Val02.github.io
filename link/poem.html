We watch for the light of the morn to break<br>
And color the eastern sky<br>
With its blended hues of saffron and lake,<br>
Then say to each other, "Awake! awake!<br>
For our winter's honey is all to make,<br>
And our bread for a long supply!"<br>
</p>
<p>
Then, off we hie to the hill and the dell,<br>
To the field, the meadow and bower.<br>
In the columbine's horn we love to dwell,<br>
To dip in the lily with snow-white bell,<br>
To search the balm in its odorous cell,<br>
The mint and the rosemary-flower.<br>
</p>
<p>
We seek the bloom of the eglantine,<br>
Of the painted thistle and brier;<br>
And follow the steps of the wandering vine,<br>
Whether it trail on the earth, supine,<br>
Or round the aspiring tree-top twine,<br>
And reach for a state still higher.<br>
</p>
<p>
As each, on the good of her sisters bent,<br>
Is busy and <strong><a href="poempart2.html">/8\</a></strong> (bet you can't catch me!) cares for all;<br>
We hope for an evening with hearts content,<br>
For the winter of life without lament<br>
That summer is gone with its hours misspent,<br>
And the harvest is past recall!<br>
